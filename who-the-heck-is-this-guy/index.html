<p>I'm Jesse Keating, a computer and bike nerd living in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>I do cloudy stuff with computers, currently for IBM. Automation is the name of&nbsp; the game.</p>
<p>I do bike stuff too. Road biking, mountain biking, mountain and cyclocross racing, cargo biking, bar hopping, just to name a few of them. I also get my family out on bikes! We frequently roll around town and participate in group rides like Kidical Mass. We also go camping on bikes.</p>
<p>You can find me on twitter, where I am <a href="http://twitter.com/iamjkeating">@iamjkeating</a></p>
