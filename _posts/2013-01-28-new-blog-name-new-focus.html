<p>I've renamed this blog to "Adventures in The Cloud".&nbsp; My day job is now DevOps for Rackspace's public cloud, and I'll occasionally blog about those adventures.&nbsp; This is where those blog posts will land.</p>
<p>Right now I'm still learning my way around things and finding places to help out, so not a lot to blog about yet.&nbsp; My first big task is a cleanup of our cloud, finding VMs that are still running that should be deleted, VMs stuck in a delete action, or VMs that aren't running any more but our DB thinks they are.&nbsp; There are various other clean up items I'm finding along the way.&nbsp; The software I'm writing to do this will likely be contributed to OpenStack upstream at some point (soon) as it'll be useful to anybody running an OpenStack based cloud.&nbsp; Nobody likes wasted resources!</p>
<p>That's all for now, back again when I have something fun to talk about.</p>
