<p>It has been a few years since I was last heavily interested in how Anaconda did it's things.&nbsp; Having recently gotten back into it for my new role, it's kinda cool to see how much has changed.</p>
<p>Composing images:<br />&nbsp; buildinstall is out, lorax is in<br />&nbsp; mkintrd is out, dracut is in</p>
<p>Booting the installer<br />&nbsp; Loader is out, dracut is in<br />&nbsp; sysvinit/upstart is out, systemd is in</p>
<p>Installer Itself<br />&nbsp; Too much really to list here, I'm still trying to get a grip on it, and it's all changing again!</p>
<p>So I've had a fun few weeks getting used to the new way of doing things, stumbling around, mumbling about "In my day!" and waiving my cane.&nbsp; The reality is that these are all really cool improvements, and it's made working on changes quite a lot easier to manage.&nbsp; I don't like that feeling that the world has moved on while I wasn't looking, but then again, that's OK, that's what the world should do.&nbsp; I just get to be that New Guy again for a bit.</p>
