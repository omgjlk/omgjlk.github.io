  content: Hey just want to say good luck in your new job.  I met you at a Tac-lug
    meeting where you helped me try out Fedora on a PPC machine.  Thanks to your help
    I have been running Linux ever since.

<p>Seven years ago I put on a Red Hat.&nbsp; I had been a part of the  community for a few years prior to that as well, first as a newbie in  #redhat looking for help, later as somebody providing help to others,  then as an early cabal member in the newly formed Fedora project, later  as a leader of Fedora Legacy.&nbsp; Along the way I've made some very strong  friendships that I hope will continue.</p>
<p>This is my last week as a Red Hatter.</p>
<p>I'd like to think that the Fedora project is a better place now than when I joined.&nbsp; I hope my time here has made a positive difference.&nbsp; My new role will leave me with less time to participate directly in Fedora, although I will likely continue maintaining a few packages here and there for my personal use.</p>
<p>I do plan on being at FUDCon in January, I hope to see many of you there.</p>
<p>I'll likely be shutting down this particular blog this week, but a new one will start and I'll link to it from here if you really like me and wish to keep tabs on what I'm doing :)</p>
