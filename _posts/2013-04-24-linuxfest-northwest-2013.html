<p>Time flies, and another <a href="http://linuxfestnorthwest.org/" target="_blank">LFNW</a> is upon us. I haven't fully decompressed from attending my first <a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/portland-2013/" target="_blank">OpenStack Summit</a> but now I have to switch gears and get ready for LFNW.</p>
<p>This year I'm giving 3 presentations, one of which is a 80 minute session that I'm sharing with a good friend -- a repeat of a popular session we did last year. Here is a link to the sessions:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://linuxfestnorthwest.org/content/git-fun-and-profit" target="_blank">Git for fun and profit!</a></li>
<li><a href="http://linuxfestnorthwest.org/content/python-magic-and-remote-apis" target="_blank">Python magic and remote APIs</a></li>
<li><a href="http://linuxfestnorthwest.org/content/infrastructure-orchestration-ansible" target="_blank">Infrastructure orchestration with Ansible</a></li>
</ul>
<p>LFNW is a free event with good quality sessions given by good quality people. The "hallway track" is just as valuable as the other tracks as you can build lasting relationships with the tech movers and shakers of the area.</p>
<p>This will be something like my 10th year going. I hope to see some of you there too!</p>
