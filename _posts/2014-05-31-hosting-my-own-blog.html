  content: I care

<p>Many moons ago I had a <a title="Single Point of Failure" href="http://jkeating.livejournal.com/" target="_blank">LiveJournal</a> blog. At the time I just didn't want to be bothered with hosting my own stuff, and there was a LiveJournal community. Many of my peers also used LiveJournal, so I followed the herd.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years and I blogged less and less, as I joined social media and participated in things like Facebook more and more. My LiveJournal basically stopped in 2010.</p>
<p>In April of 2012, I moved to the Anaconda team at Red Hat to be a full time developer on the installer software, and I decided to start blogging about that. LiveJournal felt clunky so I wanted something new and cool, and I was terrified of running my own blog software, so I got a blogspot.com account and started <a title="Adventures in the Cloud" href="http://raxcloud.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">publishing</a>. Shortly after that I left Red Hat and joined Rackspace, and gave the blog a new title.</p>
<p>Now that I'm at Rackspace working on our Public Cloud, it seems really silly to keep hosting a blog on blogspot. So I've bit the bullet as it were and created a wordpress site to keep my blogging going. I don't know what I'll post about, or how often I'll do it, or if anybody will care, but it will be therapeutic to me at least, and that's all that really matters.</p>
