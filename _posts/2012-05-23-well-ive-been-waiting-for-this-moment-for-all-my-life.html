    Option-booting? I believe I have the same air model than you, but this one has
    been particularly picky about booting from usb before.

    plugged in the USB it showed up nearly instantly.

<p>I can feel it coming in the Air tonight... </p>
<p>Excuse me a moment whilst I rock out to a killer electronic drum riff.</p>
<p>still there?&nbsp; Ok.</p>
<p>I've had a Macbook Air for a while now, not the original air, but the first redesign of it (sadly just before they did another redesign with a better chipset and backlit keyboard, oh well).&nbsp; When I first got it, I went a little crazy, and setup a triple boot system, OS X, Windows (Vista), and Fedora.&nbsp; Sadly, Fedora didn't work so hot.&nbsp; There were graphics issues, sound issues, touchpad issues, wireless issues, I mean, I think the issues had issues.</p>
<p>So instead of fighting all those issues, I did something even more silly.&nbsp; I found a virt software set in OSX that would allow me to attach a real partition to the guest.&nbsp; I setup a virtual disk image to do a minimal install of Fedora in, then edited the grub config so that it would actually load up the real disk partition as /.&nbsp; This actually worked, surprisingly well.&nbsp; I spent most the time in OSX with various X11 applications ran through ssh, and of course ssh'd into the guest to do all my command line work.&nbsp; It still felt dirty though.&nbsp; I would also let the guest boot up into graphical mode and make that go full screen in OSX Lion, which gave the illusion of using Linux native on the hardware.&nbsp; The upside was that the touchpad worked pretty well, and there weren't network issues.&nbsp; Video still sucked, no gnome-shell for me.</p>
<p>When I picked out the Air, I was thinking that it would be nice to have some hardware that was not the normal around the water cooler, so that we had a broader set of systems being used every day.&nbsp; I actually thought I could do something to fix issues that came up.&nbsp; Ha, hah.&nbsp; Turns out the most useful thing I could do was hand the system off to people who knew what they were doing. </p>
<p>Enter Super Hero <a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/" target="_blank">mjg</a> who decided (or got tasked with, I'm not sure which) that making Fedora work on Apple hardware like my Air was a thing he would do.&nbsp; And he sure did!</p>

<p>That's the Fedora 17 Final (RC3) Desktop Live image being installed to my Air.&nbsp; It couldn't have been easier.&nbsp; dd the iso to a USB stick, boot holding down option, plug in the stick (because I forgot to do that first) and pick the Fedora Media.&nbsp; Anaconda did all the right things (even when I didn't) and I now have a simple dual booting macbook.</p>
<p>F17 looks awesome.&nbsp; First time I've really used shell, and I like it.&nbsp; Audio works, graphics work, webcam works, touch pad (mostly) works, even the brightness and volume buttons work.&nbsp; I can't wait to haul it down to my local Starbucks on my bike, then show it off to my hipster friends, because you see, I was using Fedora on my Air before it was cool.</p>
<p>Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life....</p>
